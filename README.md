If you’re interested in listing your dataset, please get in touch!

Recommendations:
*Take advantage of institutional repositories. We prefer to link to a DOI or handle. 
*Check out: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/
*Keep file sizes small whenever possible. It is often not necessary to store 100% of your data. 
*For the “Recommended Challenge,” consider curating your data so that a user with limited familiarity could download all or  part of your dataset and start training a machine learning model in just a few minutes. Think of this as a starting point for what could be done with the data and code provided. The Mechanical MNIST dataset (https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/39371) is an example dataset designed to be broadly accessible. 
*If you have an interesting problem where regenerating the dataset from the provided code is quick and easy (i.e., can be done on a laptop in a few minutes by a user with no special expertise), we can post just the code.
